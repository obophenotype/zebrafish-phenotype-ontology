Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms)."

For this reason, we refer to the region adjacent and posterior to the iris as the ciliary zone, and not the ciliary body. The ciliary zone, however, is expanded and has a morphology consistent with contraction in a small area of the ventral-most region.

comment: Furthermore, zebrafish exocrine progenitors appear to arise from endoderm rostral to the gut tube, which it subsequently joins, rather than as an extension of the epithelium of the main duct. Thus, we argue against a classical model (Field et al., 2003) in which the zebrafish exocrine pancreas buds from either a rod of pre-intestinal endoderm or the gut tube which in zebrafish gives rise to the intestine (Wallace and Pack, 2003).

def: "A cell capable of processing and presenting lipid and protein antigens to T cells in order to initiate an immune response." [ZFIN:ZDB-PUB-070221-3]
comment: Note change of name; nearly all somatic cells can present antigens to T cells via MHC Class I complexes leading to effector responses, but professional antigen presenting cells constitutively express MHC Class II as well as constimulatory molecules, and thus can initiate immune responses via T cells.
