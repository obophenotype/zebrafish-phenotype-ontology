comment: These anatomical sections are applicable to most bilaterally symmetrical animals, but bipedal animals such as humans have more complex usage of these terms. For example, in post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical.
